[Verse 1]
When walking without any other goal
No past tomorrow broken down
In the cold's nothing of the street
When words no longer exists
When hope forgotten, dissolved
When even alcohols no more make drunk
Remain the scratched phrases
From those phrases we throw before giving away

[Chorus]
Lasts will be firsts
In the other reality
We'll be princes of eternity

[Verse 2]
A bill on the sidewalk
In a newspaper other stories
A sun ray randomly
An abandoned flower
What others leaved by
Not new enough, not enough
When your place is outside

[Chorus]
