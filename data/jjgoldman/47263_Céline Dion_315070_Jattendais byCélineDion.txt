[Verse 1]
And I was listening a long time fountain's water pour
And I was listening the wind sing for ever
Waves of quietude and peace
As far as I remember
Childhood is an immense ocean
And I dreamed long years, long indolence
Where nothing happens but where nothing is forgotten
I was going serene and without knowing
The smallest fire of an absence
That's only when meeting you
That I knew, I understood

[Chorus]
I was waiting, I was waiting
I was waiting your look to explain finally
The reason of these goodbyes
To that long road

[Chorus]
I was waiting, I was waiting
The country of your body the touch of your hands
My dear compass my north
The meaning to my tomorrows

[Verse 2]
And I was boarding the adolescent beaches
Doubts, games, and bad flowing
I remember the strokes
Musicâ€™s and words from France
Past lovers
There's a lot of lives faded from studies or science
Destinies make from adventures, from records or money
Lives of writing and voyages
Or from puissance dream
I thought about that from time to time
Listening the wind

[Chorus]
I was waiting, I was waiting
I was waiting your look to explain finally
The reason of these goodbyes
To that long road

[Chorus]
I was waiting, I was waiting I was waiting your love
Your lovely your beautiful love
I was waiting to finally live
By giving at my turn

[Outro]
I was waiting
