[Chorus 1]
At home the forests dance
And ceilings scratch the sky
Waters from torrents are violence
And the snows are perpetual
At home wolfs are at our doors
And all children understand them
We hear cries from New York
And boats on the Seine

[Verse 1]
Ok for your forests your wolfs your skyscrapers
Ok for your torrents your everlasting snows
I live where your eyes shine where your blood flows
Where arms squeeze me

[Chorus 2]
I'll go where you'll go, my country will be you
I'll go where you'll go whatever the place
Whatever the spot

[Verse 2]
I want coconut palms beaches
And palms under the wind
Sun fire on my face
And the ocean's blue
I want camels mirages
And captivating deserts
Caravans and travels as on brochures
Ok for your coconut palms your beaches
Ok for your lagoons all blue
I live where love is a village
Where someone's waiting for me

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Take all you have and your dreams and your life
Your words, your swearwords and your tongue from here
Go away with everything and the air girl
Show me your Eden show me your hells
Your north and your south and your west's zests

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
Whatever I'll go wherever pleases you
I love your desires I love your light
All passages look like you
When you light them

[Chorus 2]
