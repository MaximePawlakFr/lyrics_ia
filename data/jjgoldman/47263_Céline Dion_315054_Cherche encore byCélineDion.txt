[Verse 1]
There's so much walls to hold you back
To much unreachable ladders
In your dreams and in your words
You closed upside down against sadness
Somewhere where other rainbows
Draw better worlds
Search again
As long as your flame will burn
The dormant paradise
In the secrets of your soul

[Chorus]
Search again
Follow your light and your laws
If you can search again harder
And if you ever loose yourself
I'll be there, I'll be there

[Verse 2]
I want to stay in your history
A small open door
In the corridor where you're running off
Back of your memory's bars
Even where reason stops
I'll hear you without a cry
Go farther search again
As long as your
The dormant paradise
In the secrets of your soul

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And the time people still go ahead
If you fall before I'll hold you
And the winds, the years, still running around
