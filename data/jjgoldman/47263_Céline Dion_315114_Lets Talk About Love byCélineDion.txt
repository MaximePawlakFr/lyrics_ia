[Verse 1]
Everywhere I go all the places that I've been
Every smile is a new horizon on a land I've never seen
There are people around the world - different faces different names
But there's one true emotion that reminds me we're the same...
Lets talk about love
From the laughter of a child to the tears of a grown man
There's a thread that runs right through us all and helps us understand
As subtle as a breeze - that fans a flicker to a flame
From the very first sweet melody to the very last refrain

[Chorus]
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about us
Let's talk about life
Let's talk about trust
Let's talk about love

[Verse 2]
It's the king of all who live and the queen of good hearts
It's the ace you may keep up your sleeve - until the name is all but lost
As deep as any sea - with the rage of any storm
But as gentle as a falling leaf on any autumn morn...

[Chorus]
Let's talk about love - it's all were needing
Let's talk about us - it's the air we're breathing
Let's talk about life - I wanna know you
Let's talk about trust - and I wanna show you
Let's talk about love
