[Verse 1]
There is only motherfuckers that drive on a sector
Police in the TDM, the team to the inspector
There's that we must in the house, there's to scare them
There's that we must in the house, there's to scare them
You're strong but what does it serve?
There are kids of the hood that try to seduce your sister
You're in affairs, you think you're a robber
A day, you walk with robbers, a day, you walk with breakers
A day, a man suggest you money to equip you on a fazer
There are men that don't tell, there are men that smoke shit and other ones weed
Give off you if I speed up, I'm overly hurry, I smash you
A big finger for all that find problems, a MC, I decapote, I need air
I see that it zones in the hoods, this motherfuckers give me bad luck

[Chorus]
Short move and dance, yeah the rap I'm inside
I dedicate ones in a shit that rob in scooters
Short move and dance, yeah the rap I'm inside
I dedicate ones in a shit that rob in scooters

[Verse 2]
Out, everybody's gonna be with you, but into nobody's gonna think of you
Bro', we realized, you put drugs in your nose
You're seeing your brother walking, you don't want to take him
I smoked the weed of the Rif when you took sticks
We said me that you sank, that you spoke with the police
Routine became normal, smoking joint in front of the banalized
I go to my house, I'm smoking, I drink Oasis fraise/banane
I open my door on the Jaret, I see fans who take pictures
No take too certitude, I'm friendly but you're not my bro'
On Ali, she's very good, but from the base, she's a camel
And she has put you in, now she wants her Chanel bag
I put me blue under wine, my head turn, it's gonna explode
It has done 13 years that I rap, I'm still hungry to rap
I'm in my hood, I do 100 walks while I'm near to be millionaire

[Chorus]
Short move and dance, yeah the rap I'm inside
I dedicate ones in a shit that rob in scooters
Short move and dance, yeah the rap I'm inside
I dedicate ones in a shit that rob in scooters

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I'm nervous so I do the best with the police
And when I'm in La Siou, I do noise the motor of Panam'
Too many problems, that it turns from the fowl to the donkey
Out, it's not into, so my child, go tidy your arm!
T-Max in Y, so this con, he fears
I don't know how he's gonna avoid the 308 break
You want test me? Don't touch my team, grace it, I'm done of gold and platinum
It's summer, I take out the car and I put the blond platinum hair

[Chorus]
Short move and dance, yeah the rap I'm inside
I dedicate ones in a shit that rob in scooters
Short move and dance, yeah the rap I'm inside
I dedicate ones in a shit that rob in scooters
