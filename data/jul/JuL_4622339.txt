VERSE
I spent a summer
Writing songs on heartbreak
Tryin to forget ya
Leave you lost in the lights
Doing what i can
To fix all of my heartache
I keep it inside
Like a shadow in the night

CHORUS
Cause I got lost in your city
And I believed it was home
I thought that you would stick with me
But I'm better alone
Better alone
I bet you don’t even miss me
I don't care cause I know
Forever is not what you're giving
So I’m letting you go
Goodbye, Tokyo

VERSE
Hanging on your kiss
Looking back when I'm lonely
Do you think that
I'm a fool to say so?
Do you ever miss
Me when you're happy
Or have you moved on
I don't wanna know

BRIDGE
They say
I'll forget you with time
They'll say
I'll forget you with time
They’ll say
Goodbye

CHORUS
Cause I got lost in your city
And I believed it was home
I thought that you would stick with me
But I’m better alone
Better alone
I bet you don't even miss me
I don’t care cause I know
Forever is not what you're giving
So I'm letting you go
Goodbye, Tokyo

Goodbye, Tokyo
