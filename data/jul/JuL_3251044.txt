[Intro]
Yo What's Up ?
Yo What's Up ?
Come in my trip come on let's go
They are talkin about me but I let them man
Take your girl I don't have a leash
All we can see it's her ass man
Yeah Yeah I kill everything
I'll never say I give up on everything
Oh that dumb ass want to test me ouuh
Take this slap in your face ouuh
I drive around in the hood it's dead
I raise my hand to some traitor and I tell them

[Chorus]
Hook
Yo what's up ?
Yo What's up ?
Yo What's up ?
Get your weed, your plaque
I'm in this game in flip flop
In the VIP Room in sweat pants
Don't come break my head

[Verse 2]
Yo the blood, yo the Honda
My music is played out at the Jonque
You betrayed me but you were a good guy
I'm smoked too much but I don't make no mistake
It's has been 2 years that I fucked everything in the game
How dare you asking me what's my name ?
I only ask you one thing
Leave Ju-Ju-Jul alone
Because everything is fucked in his head
Always having ideas, yes never without one
I can see the moon going down when I drive on the A7
I know the haters listen to me in secret
And everywhere else they listen to me in tape

[Chorus]
Yo what's up ?
Yo What's up ?
Yo What's up ?
Get your weed, your plaque
I'm in this game in flip flop
In the VIP Room in sweat pants
Don't come break my head

[Verse 3]
You got some bills, you got the R1
You go around with hidden plaque, you going to smoke one
I'm small like Mathy Mimie
I don't know but I think your team copy on me
Tonight I'll be drunk by midnight
I didn't change bro, I kept my values
I don't want hurt you, I know you are very cute
You tell me see you later but since you owe me money
I'm going to see you again I'll tell you ..

[Hook] (x2)
Yo what's up ?
Yo What's up ?
Yo What's up ?
Get your weed, your plaque
I'm in this game in flip flop
In the VIP Room in sweat pants
Don't come break my head

[Bridge]
Yo what's up ?
Yo what's up

[Verse 4]
It's has been 2 years that I fucked everything in the game
How dare you asking me what's my name ?
I only ask you one thing
Leave Ju-Ju-Jul alone
Because everything is fucked in his head
Always having ideas, yes never without one
I can see the moon going down when I drive on the A7
I know the haters listen to me in secret
And people from the country listen to me in tape

[Outro]
Yo what's up ?
Yo What's up ?
Yo What's up ?
